Hi, I’m Nandini R. Maharana (she/her) and I specialize in Frontend Development, AI/ML, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Computer Vision (CV). I am passionate about building intelligent systems that combine thoughtful design with data-driven insight. I am currently exploring backend development to round out my full-stack capabilities. Open to collaborations on projects aligned with AI, NLP, CV, or modern web technologies.
Reach me at: nandinirmaharana@gmail.com
Fun fact: I love writing—whether it's stories or clean, elegant code.
